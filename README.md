# NMAP-XML-Parse-to-CSV
Parse NMAP XML output for IP Address, Hostname and CPE/OS Version to CSV file

Based on AccentureTVM's Python-Nmap-XML-to-CSV https://github.com/AccentureTVM/Python-Nmap-XML-to-CSV

I needed something similar to what AccentureTVM's script provided, but only needed to return the IP, Hostname and OS, so I modified his script to suit my needs.
